  "body": "# Udacity_FEND_P2\r\nAnimal Trading Card\r\n\r\nThis project consisted of a prototype of an animal trading card. I utilized HTML and CSS displaying my growth of research and applying multiple elements to create the trading card. To conclude, I applied border style, measurements for width, height, margin, padding, background color, font weight, page wrap, and container. \r\n",
